      <p>Search and destroy is a vintage shop located on St. Marks Street. It sells several clothes ranging from band shirts to one of a kind pieces. The interior of the store really caught my attention as they use a lot of miscellaneous pieces like barbie heads, dildos, and stuffed animals to decorate the walls and ceiling. Everything looks like a mess at first and the music they play can be really loud and disruptive. But you can't deny that this place will leave you with an experience like no other. I definitely recommend giving this place a try if you are looking for a novel experience while vintage shopping!</p>
